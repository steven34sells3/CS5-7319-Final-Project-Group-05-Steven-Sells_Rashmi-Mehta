Only the immediate sensor inputs cause it to react. Without being aware of the room's borders, the agent would have to investigate it, possibly going over cleansed portions again or overlooking unclean ones. The agent would waste time and energy going backwards, which would become more inefficient as the room size increased. In this case, the Model-Based Reflex Agent would function more effectively. By keeping note of its location and the squares it has cleaned, it may keep an internal model of the space. It can learn the room's size through exploration, even though it doesn't know it at first. The agent will get adept at avoiding going back to cleaned squares, which will result in leading to a more efficient cleaning process.\n",

Its lack of recall may cause it to overlook specific locations or become trapped in confined settings. It might not be able to efficiently map out and clean the entire irregular region if it relies on real-time sensor inputs to direct its efforts.\n",
        "This situation would be handled far more effectively by the Model-Based Reflex Agent. It is capable of tracking its movements and identifying and cleaning every part of the uneven region using its internal model.

The agent may avoid going in a certain direction if an obstacle activates a bumper sensor, but it may wind up getting stuck or taking wasteful routes if it lacks a long-term memory. The agent would be incapable of identifying barriers or effectively adjusting to them.\n",
        "In an obstacle-filled area, the Model-Based Reflex Agent would function better. It can learn to avoid obstacles since it keeps track of its previous motions and their positions.

        "When it comes to imperfect sensors, the Model-Based Reflex Agent is more resilient. The agent can avoid going over previously cleaned areas by using its internal model, even with a 10% mistake rate. The agent's recollection of cleansed squares would assist reduce inefficiencies, however sporadic dirt sensor mistakes would still result in some.

Implement a utility-based agent that maximizes the expected utility over one full charge which lasts for 100000 time steps. To do this, the agent needs to learn the probabilities with which different squares get dirty again. This is very tricky!"
