Overview
This C++ project implements a basic telehealth system with various components that interact to provide telehealth functionalities. The system includes a user interface, a telehealth application, a nurse line service, a database, communication and security modules, external system integrations, analytics, and notification services.

Project Structure
The project is structured into several classes, each representing a specific component of the telehealth system. The main file, main.cpp, demonstrates the usage of these classes and their interactions. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

main.cpp: Entry point of the program, demonstrating the usage of classes and methods.
User.cpp, Nurse.cpp, ...: Implementation files for each class.
CommunicationModule.h, NotificationService.h, ...: Header files for communication and notification-related modules.
Database.h, SecurityModule.h, ...: Header files for database and security-related modules.
Components
User Class:

Manages user attributes and methods for login, logout, and consultation requests.
Nurse Class:

Represents nurse entities with attributes and methods for checking availability and conducting consultations.
TelehealthSystem Class:

Orchestrates user and nurse interactions, schedules appointments, and maintains user and nurse lists.
CommunicationModule Class:

Handles communication protocols, initiating calls, and sending text messages.
NotificationService Class:

Manages sending notifications and setting reminders for appointments.
Database Class:

Provides methods for saving user, nurse, and appointment data.
SecurityModule Class:

Ensures secure data transactions through methods like data encryption and user authentication.
ExternalSystem Class:

Integrates with external systems such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and billing systems.
AnalyticsModule Class:

Collects and analyzes data for performance metrics and system improvement.
Usage
To use this telehealth system implementation, follow these steps:
